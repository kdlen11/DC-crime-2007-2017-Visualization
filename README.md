# DC-crime-2013-Choropleth-Map

Utilized in a group project in Data Visualization course, meant to illustrate the safest times and places to visit DC.

Repository contains code used to make ANC Choropleth map, as well as the final product into which the map was implemented.

Crime data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinchinzu/dc-metro-crime-data) and Geometry data from Open Data Dc (https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::advisory-neighborhood-commissions-from-2013/about).

ANC = Advisory Neighborhood Committee. 
Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) are collections of Single Member Districts (SMDs). ANCs allow input from an advisory board made up of the residents of the neighborhoods directly affected by government action (Open Data DC).

ANC boundaries are redrawn ever 10 years, most recently in 2023. Crime data ranges from 2007-2007, and exploratory analytics showed that most crimes fell between the 2012-2023 range, so map was drawn using 2013 ANC boundaries.
